        <h1>Premier Dental Care: Office Manager</h1>
        <p>
            As an Office Manager, I managed all phases of the Dental practice. I was the liaison 
            between the doctors and patients in discussing treatment/payments plans. I was also 
            responsible for posting dental transactions using Softdent software, verifying and 
            filing insurance claims, as well as maintaining and purchasing office supplies. In addition 
            to handling collections and generating monthly statements, I was also responsible for 
            accounts payables, accounts receivables, payroll, quarterly estimated taxes, orchestrating 
            monthly staff meetings, assisting with staff scheduling and maintaining the smooth 
            flow and operation of the office with both staff and patients.

        <p>
            Worked as a Contractor converting flat files in the Information System's
            Department. After 3 months, I was offered permanent full-time employment
            which I graciously declined due to the fact that I was also a volunteer
            full-time missionary and only had need of part-time employment. Continued 
            to work for 2 years as a Bookkeeper for AFJ Computer Services, Inc.
